      <description>Suppose that you were given a blurred image:
Then you could probably tell that it was generated from this image:
But what about if you instead were given indirect observations of the image, such as the line integrals taken over some set of lines:
Would you still tell it came from the image above? Probably not. But we will demonstrate how we can teach a computer to do it.</description>

      <description>Instructions for installing and configuring Ubuntu 16.04 LTE on a PC with two GPUs.
The primary GPU will be used for computations and the secondary one will be used for displaying graphics. In this example, the computer is a HP Z640 with NVIDIA Titan-X Pascal as primary GPU and a NVIDIA Quadro K620 as secondary GPU.
Note: if the computer already have a working installation of Ubuntu 16.04 with build-essentials installed you should (probably) not have to reinstall it, meaning that the first two steps can be skipped.</description>
